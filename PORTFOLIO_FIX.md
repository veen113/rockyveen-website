# Portfolio Page Fix

## Issue
The `/portfolio` page was not showing all collaborations and images because it was using the old `projects` data structure instead of the new `collaborations` data.

## Solution
Completely rebuilt the portfolio page to use the `collaborations` data with all images and modern styling.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Data Source Updated**
- ✅ Changed from `projects` to `collaborations` data
- ✅ Now shows all 43+ brand collaborations
- ✅ All images are properly displayed

### 2. **Filter System Simplified**
**Before:**
- 3 separate filters (Niche, Platform, Format)
- Complex filtering logic
- Based on non-existent project data

**After:**
- Single category filter
- Categories: All, Food & Beverage, Beauty & Fashion, Tech, Health
- Matches the collaboration data structure

### 3. **Card Design Modernized**
- ✅ Square aspect ratio images (instead of 4:3)
- ✅ Gradient overlays on hover (purple/pink)
- ✅ Colored borders with glow effect
- ✅ Lift animation on hover
- ✅ Featured and badge labels
- ✅ Two action buttons per card:
  - "Visit" - Links to brand website
  - "View Collab" - Links to Instagram post

### 4. **Visual Enhancements**
- ✅ Gradient text on "Portfolio" heading
- ✅ Gradient primary buttons
- ✅ Colored shadows with primary color tint
- ✅ Modern card hover effects
- ✅ Smooth animations on load
- ✅ Responsive grid layout

### 5. **Content Updates**
- ✅ Shows actual collaboration count (43+)
- ✅ All brand images displayed
- ✅ All brand descriptions shown
- ✅ Links to brand websites
- ✅ Links to Instagram collaborations
- ✅ Category-based filtering

## Data Structure Used

```typescript
{
  id: string
  name: string
  category: 'food-beverage' | 'beauty-fashion' | 'tech' | 'health'
  description: string
  image: string (path to image)
  link: string (brand website)
  instagramLink?: string (Instagram collab post)
  featured?: boolean
  badge?: 'NEW' | 'PREMIUM'
}
```

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add search functionality
2. Add sorting options (A-Z, newest, etc.)
3. Add pagination for better performance
4. Add individual collaboration detail pages
5. Add share buttons

The portfolio page now properly displays all brand collaborations with images and modern styling! 🎨✨
