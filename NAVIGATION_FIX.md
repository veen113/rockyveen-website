# Navigation Links Fix

## Issue
Navigation links in the header didn't work when on pages like `/portfolio` or `/services` because they were using anchor-only links (`#services`, `#about`, etc.) which only work on the home page.

## Solution
Updated navigation to use full paths with hash fragments (`/#services`, `/#about`) that work from any page, and enhanced the smooth scroll component to handle cross-page navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Navigation Links Updated**

**Before:**
```typescript
{ name: 'Services', href: '#services' }
{ name: 'About Us', href: '#about' }
{ name: 'Our Collabs', href: '#collabs' }
{ name: 'Contact', href: '#contact' }
```

**After:**
```typescript
{ name: 'Home', href: '/' }
{ name: 'Services', href: '/#services' }
{ name: 'About Us', href: '/#about' }
{ name: 'Our Collabs', href: '/portfolio' }
{ name: 'Contact', href: '/#contact' }
```

### 2. **Active State Logic Updated**

Updated the logic to properly highlight active links:
- Checks if current pathname matches link
- Checks if on home page with matching section
- Checks if on portfolio page

```typescript
const isActive = 
  item.href === pathname || 
  (item.href.startsWith('/#') && pathname === '/' && item.href.includes(activeSection)) ||
  (item.href === '/portfolio' && pathname === '/portfolio')
```

### 3. **Smooth Scroll Enhanced**

Added intelligent navigation handling:
- **From other pages**: Navigates to home page first, then scrolls to section
- **On home page**: Scrolls directly to section
- **On page load**: Automatically scrolls to hash if present in URL

```typescript
// Handle links like /#services from other pages
if (href && href.startsWith('/#')) {
  if (window.location.pathname !== '/') {
    router.push(href) // Navigate to home with hash
  } else {
    // Already on home, just scroll
    scrollToElement(hash)
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Navigation Behavior

1. **From Portfolio/Services â†’ Home Sections**
   - Click "Services" â†’ Navigates to `/#services`
   - Page loads home page
   - Automatically scrolls to services section

2. **From Home â†’ Home Sections**
   - Click "Services" â†’ Smooth scrolls to services section
   - No page reload

3. **From Any Page â†’ Portfolio**
   - Click "Our Collabs" â†’ Navigates to `/portfolio`
   - Shows full portfolio page

4. **From Any Page â†’ Home**
   - Click "Home" â†’ Navigates to `/`
   - Loads home page

### Active Link Highlighting

- **On Home Page**: Highlights based on scroll position
  - Scrolled to services â†’ "Services" is highlighted
  - Scrolled to about â†’ "About Us" is highlighted
  
- **On Portfolio Page**: "Our Collabs" is highlighted

- **On Other Pages**: Corresponding nav item is highlighted

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/layout/header.tsx`**
   - Updated navigation links to use full paths
   - Updated active state logic for both desktop and mobile
   - Works from any page

2. **`src/components/smooth-scroll.tsx`**
   - Added router for cross-page navigation
   - Handle `/#hash` links from any page
   - Auto-scroll on page load with hash
   - Smooth scroll within same page

## Testing

### Test Navigation From Portfolio Page
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/portfolio`
2. Click "Services" â†’ Should navigate to home and scroll to services
3. Click "About Us" â†’ Should navigate to home and scroll to about
4. Click "Contact" â†’ Should navigate to home and scroll to contact
5. Click "Home" â†’ Should navigate to home page top

### Test Navigation From Home Page
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`
2. Click "Services" â†’ Should smooth scroll to services section
3. Click "About Us" â†’ Should smooth scroll to about section
4. Click "Our Collabs" â†’ Should navigate to portfolio page
5. Click "Contact" â†’ Should smooth scroll to contact form

### Test Active States
1. On home page, scroll down â†’ Nav links highlight based on section
2. On portfolio page â†’ "Our Collabs" is highlighted
3. Click any nav link â†’ Correct link becomes active
