## After Deployment

### Your Website URLs

**Production URL**: `https://rockyveen-website.vercel.app`
(or custom domain if you set one up)

**Preview URLs**: Every git push creates a preview URL

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain (e.g., `rockyveen.com`)
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

## Automatic Deployments

Once connected to GitHub:
- ‚úÖ Every push to `main` branch = Production deployment
- ‚úÖ Every push to other branches = Preview deployment
- ‚úÖ Every pull request = Preview deployment

---

## Environment Variables (If Needed Later)

If you need to add environment variables:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
4. Add variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

(Currently not needed - credentials are in code)

---

## Build Settings

Your `package.json` should have these scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

Vercel will automatically run `npm run build` during deployment.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify no TypeScript errors locally: `npm run build`

### Images Not Loading
- Make sure images are in `/public` folder
- Use relative paths: `/images/photo.jpg`

### EmailJS Not Working
- Verify public key is correct
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure EmailJS service is active

### 404 Errors
- Check file paths are correct
- Verify routing in Next.js app directory
