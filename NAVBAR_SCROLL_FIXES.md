### 4. **Active Section Highlighting**

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files:

1. **`src/components/layout/header.tsx`**
   - Updated navigation links to use anchor links (#services, #about, etc.)
   - Added `activeSection` state for scroll-based highlighting
   - Improved active state logic for both desktop and mobile
   - Added padding to nav container

2. **`src/components/smooth-scroll.tsx`**
   - Replaced Lenis library with native smooth scroll
   - Added custom anchor link click handler
   - Proper offset calculation for fixed header (80px)
   - Clean event listener management

3. **`src/components/home/hero-section.tsx`**
   - Added pt-20 to top bar to prevent header overlap

4. **`src/app/collabs/page.tsx`**
   - Adjusted padding-top to pt-20

5. **`src/app/portfolio/page.tsx`**
   - Adjusted padding-top to pt-20

## How It Works Now

### Smooth Scrolling
```typescript
// Native CSS smooth scroll
document.documentElement.style.scrollBehavior = 'smooth'

// Custom anchor handler with header offset
const headerOffset = 80
const offsetPosition = elementPosition + window.pageYOffset - headerOffset
window.scrollTo({ top: offsetPosition, behavior: 'smooth' })
```

### Active Section Detection
```typescript
// Detects which section is currently in view
const sections = ['services', 'about', 'collabs', 'contact']
const current = sections.find(section => {
  const element = document.getElementById(section)
  if (element) {
    const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect()
    return rect.top <= 100 && rect.bottom >= 100
  }
  return false
})
```

### Navigation Structure
- **Home** → `/` (top of page)
- **Services** → `#services` (scrolls to services section)
- **About Us** → `#about` (scrolls to about section)
- **Our Collabs** → `#collabs` (scrolls to collabs section)
- **Contact** → `#contact` (scrolls to contact section)

## Benefits

1. **No More Scroll Freezing** - Removed problematic Lenis library
2. **Smooth Navigation** - Native smooth scroll is more reliable
3. **Better UX** - Active section highlighting shows where user is
4. **Proper Spacing** - No content hidden behind fixed header
5. **Mobile Friendly** - Works perfectly on all devices
6. **Performance** - Lighter weight without external scroll library

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Scroll works smoothly without stopping
- ✅ Navigation links scroll to correct sections
- ✅ Active link highlights based on scroll position
- ✅ Mobile menu works correctly
- ✅ No content hidden behind header
- ✅ Theme toggle works
- ✅ All pages have proper spacing
- ✅ Smooth scroll on anchor clicks
- ✅ Header becomes solid on scroll

## Notes

- Header offset is set to 80px (adjustable in `smooth-scroll.tsx`)
- Active section detection threshold is 100px from top
- Scroll behavior automatically resets to 'auto' on component unmount
- All anchor links are handled automatically by the smooth scroll component
